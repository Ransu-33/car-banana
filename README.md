car-banana readme

In this project, we take a look at a dataset of car sales advertisements. We're interested in factors such as the distribution of price based on the vehicles brand, and when people may start thinking about selling their car by looking at the odometer readings of the vehicles. We are also going to incorporate this data into an interactive web application so that users can make their own comparisons and conclusions.

Libraries used:

pandas
plotly.express
streamlit

Launching project:
Make sure the respective libraries are install on your system.
Open EDA.ipynb and app.py in any application that supports these files (VSCode recommended)

Launching the web app locally:

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Make sure streamlit is installed in your system.
3. Change the directory to where the app.py is saved.
4. Run the following command in the terminal:

streamlit run app.py

If done correctly, a local URL will show up in the terminal. It should look something like this:

Local URL: http://localhost:8501

Open the URL in your browser of choice and enjoy the project!
